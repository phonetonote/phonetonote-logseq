after installing, put your `ptn_key` and optionally a `ptn_hashtag` in the plugin settings file wherever you have logseq installed `.logseq/settings/_ptn.json`. you can also open this file by navigating to your logseq plugins, hovering over the settings icon in the phonetonote-logseq plugin, and clicking `Open settings`.
